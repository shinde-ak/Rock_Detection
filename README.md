<h1> Introductcion</h1>
The automatic identification of rock type in the field would aid geological surveying, education, and 
automatic mapping. Deep learning is receiving significant research attention for pattern recognition 
and machine learning. Its application here has effectively identified rock types from images captured 
in the field. This paper proposes an accurate approach for identifying rock types in the field based on 
image analysis using deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed approach can identify three 
common rock types with an overall classification accuracy of 96.6%, thus outperforming other 
established deep-learning models and a linear model. The results show that the proposed approach 
based on deep learning represents an improvement in intelligent rock-type identification and solves 
several difficulties facing the automated identification of rock types in the field
